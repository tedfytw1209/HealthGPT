## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to **HealthGPT!** 🚀
**HealthGPT** is an advanced medical Large Vision-Language Model with a unified framework that integrates both medical visual comprehension and generation capabilities. In this project, a **heterogeneous low rank adaptation (H-LoRA)** and a **three-stage learning strategy** are proposed, enabling the pre-trained large language model to efficiently follow both visual comprehension and generation instructions.

# 🔥 News
- **[2025.02.26]** We have released the UI/UX for the inference.
- **[2025.02.17]** We have released the pre-trained weight on HuggingFace and inference script. 
### TODO
- [x] Release inference code.
- [x] Release the pre-trained weight of the model.
- [x] Release the inference UI/UX.
- [ ] Release VL-Health dataset.
- [ ] Release training scripts.
- [ ] Construct the website.

### 📚 Task Classification and Support
**HealthGPT** supports **7** types of medical comprehension tasks and **5** types of medical generation tasks, outperforming recent unified visual models and medical-specific models.

### 🏗️ Architecture
The HealthGPT architecture integrates **hierarchical visual perception** and **H-LoRA**, employing a task-specific hard router to select visual features and H-LoRA plugins, generating text and vision outputs with an autoregressive manner.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
We have released our model in two configurations, **HealthGPT-M3** and **HealthGPT-L14**, to suit different requirements and resource availability:
- HealthGPT-M3: A smaller version optimized for speed and reduced memory usage.
- HealthGPT-L14: A larger version designed for higher Performance and more complex tasks.

### Installation
**1. Prepare Environment**

First, clone our repository and create the Python environment for running HealthGPT using the following command:
```
# clone our project
git clone https://github.com/DCDmllm/HealthGPT.git
cd HealthGPT

# prepare python environment
conda create -n HealthGPT python=3.10
conda activate HealthGPT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Prepare Pre-trained Weights**

HealthGPT utilizes `clip-vit-large-patch14-336` as the visual encoder and employs `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` and `phi-4` as the pre-trained LLM base models for HealthGPT-M3 and HealthGPT-L14, respectively. Please download the corresponding weights:
|Model Type|Model Name|Download|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|ViT|`clip-vit-large-patch14-336`|[Download](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336)|
|Base Model (HealthGPT-M3)|`Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`|[Download](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct)|
|Base Model (HealthGPT-L14)|`phi-4`|[Download](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4)|

For medical vision generation tasks, please follow the [official VQGAN guide](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers) and download the `VQGAN OpenImages (f=8), 8192` model weights from the `"Overview of pretrained models"` section. Below is the direct link to the corresponding VQGAN pre-trained weights:
|Model Name|Download|
|:-:|:-:|
|VQGAN OpenImages (f=8), 8192, GumbelQuantization|[Download](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/2e5662443a6b4307b470/?p=%2F&mode=list)|

After downloading, place the `last.ckpt` and `model.yaml` files in the `taming_transformers/ckpt` directory.

**3. Prepare H-LoRA and Adapter Weights**

HealthGPT enhances the base model's capabilities for medical visual comprehension and generation by training a small number of H-LoRA parameters and adapter layers for aligning vision and text. We have currently released some weights from the training process, supporting `medical visual question answering` and `open-world visual reconstruction` tasks. Here are the corresponding weights: [Download](https://huggingface.co/lintw/HealthGPT-M3).

We will soon be releasing the full weights for HealthGPT-L14, along with the H-LoRA weights for medical generation tasks. Stay tuned!!!

## ⚡ Inference
### Medical Visual Question Answering

To perform inference using HealthGPT, please follow these steps:

1. Download Necessary Files:
    - Ensure you have downloaded all the required model weights and resources.
2. Update Script Paths:
    - Open the script located at `llava/demo/com_infer.sh`.
    - Modify the following variables to point to the paths where you stored the downloaded files:
        - MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH: Path or identifier for base model.
        - VIT_PATH: Path to the Vision Transformer model weights.
        - HLORA_PATH: Path to the [HLORA weights](https://huggingface.co/lintw/HealthGPT-M3/blob/main/com_hlora_weights.bin) file for visual comprehension.
        - FUSION_LAYER_PATH: Path to your [fusion layer weights](https://huggingface.co/lintw/HealthGPT-M3/blob/main/fusion_layer_weights.bin) file.
3. Run the Script:
    - Execute the script in your terminal to begin inference:
        ```
        cd llava/demo
        bash com_infer.sh
        ```

You can directly run the Python command in your terminal by specifying the paths and parameters. This approach allows you to easily change the image or question as needed:
```
python3 com_infer.py \
    --model_name_or_path "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct" \
    --dtype "FP16" \
    --hlora_r "64" \
    --hlora_alpha "128" \
    --hlora_nums "4" \
    --vq_idx_nums "8192" \
    --instruct_template "phi3_instruct" \
    --vit_path "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336/" \
    --hlora_path "path/to/your/local/com_hlora_weights.bin" \
    --fusion_layer_path "path/to/your/local/fusion_layer_weights.bin" \
    --question "Your question" \
    --img_path "path/to/image.jpg"

```

- Customize the Question and Image: You can modify the `--question` and `--img_path` parameters to ask different questions or analyze different images.

Correspondingly, the visual Question Answering task of `HealthGPT-L14` can be executed with the following Python command:
```
python3 com_infer_phi4.py \
    --model_name_or_path "microsoft/Phi-4" \
    --dtype "FP16" \
    --hlora_r "32" \
    --hlora_alpha "64" \
    --hlora_nums "4" \
    --vq_idx_nums "8192" \
    --instruct_template "phi4_instruct" \
    --vit_path "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336/" \
    --hlora_path "path/to/your/local/com_hlora_weights_phi4.bin" \
    --question "Your question" \
    --img_path "path/to/image.jpg"

```
The weights of `com_hlora_weights_phi4.bin` can be downloaded [here](https://huggingface.co/lintw/HealthGPT-L14).

### Image Reconstruction
Similarly, simply set the `HLORA_PATH` to point to the [`gen_hlora_weights.bin`](https://huggingface.co/lintw/HealthGPT-M3/blob/main/gen_hlora_weights.bin) file and configure the other model paths. Then, you can perform the image reconstruction task using the following script:
```
cd llava/demo
bash gen_infer.sh
```

You can also directly execute the following python command:
```
python3 gen_infer.py \
    --model_name_or_path "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct" \
    --dtype "FP16" \
    --hlora_r "256" \
    --hlora_alpha "512" \
    --hlora_nums "4" \
    --vq_idx_nums "8192" \
    --instruct_template "phi3_instruct" \
    --vit_path "openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336/" \
    --hlora_path "path/to/your/local/gen_hlora_weights.bin" \
    --fusion_layer_path "path/to/your/local/fusion_layer_weights.bin" \
    --question "Reconstruct the image." \
    --img_path "path/to/image.jpg" \
    --save_path "path/to/save.jpg"

```

## Server

### 📌 Project Introduction
This project is a **Gradio** front-end interface, supporting users:
- **Analyze image (comprehension task)**: input text + image, output **text**
- **Generate image (generation task)**: input text + image, output **image**

### 📦 Installation Dependencies
This project runs based on Python, and requires the installation of `Gradio` and `Pillow`.

```bash
pip install gradio pillow
```

### ▶️ Run the project
Run the following command in the terminal:
